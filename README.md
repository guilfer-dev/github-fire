[DOOM Fire](https://github.com/filipedeschamps/doom-fire-algorithm) implementation on contributions calendar from GitHub.

Heavily inspired by a similar project made some years ago by [L. Pereira](https://github.com/lpereira)

Thanks for the inspiration, guys!

## Applying temporarily on any Github  profile:

Using DevTools, go to the source tab, copy the code on "fire.js" file and past it on a new snippet.

After that, just run the renderAnimation function on your browser's terminal!
